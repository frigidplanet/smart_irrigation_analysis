# Smart Irrigation Analysis

### Motivation

Was my smart irrigation device actually providing value or was it just a neat toy?  I assumed it was saving me money but I didn't know for sure.  I wanted to find out if it actually was or if it was all in my head.

### Summary of results

Overall, it has saved me money.  But it cost me even more money by not installing it sooner.  Not to mention all the water that was wasted over 20 months of not using a smart device.

There is not enough data for it to be scientifically accurate, but as of right now it was worth the cost.
